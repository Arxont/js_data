Specifically, these tasks are geared around preparing\ndata for further analysis and visualization.\n\nThis guide will demonstrate some basic techniques and how to implement them\nusing core JavaScript API, the [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) library and [lodash](http://lodash.com/).\n\nIt assumes you already have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.\n\n## Contributors\n\n[Jim Vallandingham](https://twitter.com/vlandham) put together much of the original content of [Learn JS Data](http://learnjsdata.com) but there have also been contributions from:\n\n- [Irene Ros](https://twitter.com/ireneros)\n- [Timo Grossenbacher](https://twitter.com/grssnbchr)\n- [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce)\n- [Kanit Ham Wong](https://twitter.com/kanitw)\n- [Yannick Assogba](https://twitter.com/tafsiri)\n- [Earle Castledine](https://twitter.com/mrspeaker)\n- [Lynn Cherny](https://twitter.com/arnicas)\n- [David Koop](https://twitter.com/koopdakoop)\n\n## Tasks\n + [Getting Started](/@dakoop/getting-started-learn-js-data)\n + [Reading in Data](/@dakoop/reading-in-data-learn-js-data)\n + [Combining Data](/@dakoop/combining-data-learn-js-data)\n + [Summarizing Data](/@dakoop/summarizing-data-learn-js-data)\n + [Iterating and Reducing](/@dakoop/iterating-over-and-reducing-data-learn-js-data)\n + [Nesting and Grouping Data](/@dakoop/grouping-data-learn-js-data)\n + [Working with Strings](/@dakoop/working-with-strings-learn-js-data)\n + [Regular Expressions](/@dakoop/regular-expressions-learn-js-data)\n + [Working with Time](/@dakoop/working-with-time-learn-js-data)\n + [Checking Data Assumptions](/@dakoop/checking-data-assumptions-learn-js-data)\n\n## News\n\n + **05/17/2018**: The guide has been updated to use **D3v5** and Observable. [David Koop](https://twitter.com/koopdakoop) completed this conversion by importing the [original source](https://github.com/vlandham/js_data), updating the code to work with Observable, and adding some details on arrow functions, spread syntax, and template literals. The section on Node has not yet been added because it doesn't work as well with Observable. Let [Dave](http://twitter.com/koopdakoop) know if you find issues in the translation or updates. If you need the D3v4 guide, it's still at [learnjsdata.com](http://learnjsdata.com).\n\n + **03/20/2017**: We've updated the guide to use **D3v4**!! Thanks very much to [Kanit Ham Wong](https://twitter.com/kanitw) and others at the [UW Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/) for support, suggestions, and motivation for this process. Thanks to [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce) for doing most of the converting! If you need the old D3v3 guide, it's been archived [here](http://learnjsdata.com/v3).\n\n## Code\n\nEach notebook in this guide is executed when loaded into a browser. Outputs are shown inline, right above the code that produces them.\n`",

Often times, however, you are already familiar with a particular language (like JavaScript) and would like to get started with data, but want to take it one step at a time.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes you are already in a particular environment (like JavaScript) and don't have the luxury of switching to one of these other options.\n\nIn these cases, JavaScript could be considered a viable option for your data analysis. And if you find yourself in one of these situations, or just want to try out JavaScript for data analysis for fun, then _this guide is for you_!\n\nCheck out some of the tasks, and see if JavaScript Data something you want to try yourself.\n`",
